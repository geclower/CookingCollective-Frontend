### Functionality

With the Cooking Collective you can browse through a wide range of recipes spanning different countries with varying main ingredients. Each recipe is fully available and soon you will be able to add your own recipes as well!

See below for how these pages look.

##### Filter Function:

You can filter either by the course you are looking to prepare or by the main ingredient of the dish.

##### Recipe:

The recipe card shows all ingredients with measurements along with detailed instructions. There are also optional links for a video walkthrough or a source. If the recipe doesn't have one or both of these, the buttons will not appear.
